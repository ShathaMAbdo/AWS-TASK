# **STAR method**
• **Situation:** One time, at my last job, my coworker had a family emergency and needed to miss work for some time, and their super-important project was left unfinished and without a manager.

•**Task**: My supervisor instructed me to take on the project, and with no leniency on the deadline, I had days to complete a project that originally should have taken several weeks.

•**Actions:**  I requested and was granted a reduction in my weekly goals, allotting me more time to attack the special project. Regarding my weekly goals, I could delegate them evenly to some of my teammates

•**Results:** With the reduction in my daily goals, I could dedicate more time to the special project. This allowed me to finish it on time and with complete accuracy. My supervisor appreciated my attitude and drive, and I was given several more projects after that, along with an eventual promotion and pay raise.
